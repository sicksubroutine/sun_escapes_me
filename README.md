"Sun Escapes Me" is an entry into my first game jam -- LOWREZJAM 2022. This is a game jam in which all entries must have a game resolution of at most 64x64px. This is a rather stark constraint for most who are used to 1080p resolutions or higher. This is to make my final goal a little more mangable to aim for. 

## Controls

Use the arrow keys for your movement. 

Press the X key to fire energy weapons.

Press Z to start the game.

## What is?

### An *"OMG THE SUN IS PISSED AND YOU NEED TO ESCAPE"*... game.

For some reason the SUN is really *PISSED*. You better be pushing your engines to the limit to escape! The gravity well of the SUN is slowly increasing over time. The gravity meter is seen along the bottom of the screen.

Asteroids knock you back and nebulas seize up your engine for a brief time.

You can use energy weapons to blow up asteroids before they hit you but if your weapons hit a nebula, they'll bounce back at you! Maybe you can use that to your advantage somehow?

## Why is?

Made for the LOWREZJAM 2022 game jam! This is actually my (Chaz) first game jam ever! LOWREZJAM was picked because of the 64x64px requirement. It was very much in line with my current experiences with pixel art and the Pico 8 fantasy console. Actually got it submitted in time and everything too!
