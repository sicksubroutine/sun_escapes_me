# Sun Escapes Me

"Sun Escapes Me" is an entry into my first game jam -- LOWREZJAM 2022. This is a game jam in which all entries must have a game screen size of at most 64x64px. This is a rather stark constraint for most who are used to 1080p resolutions or higher. This is to make my final goal a little more mangable to aim for. 

Will update this more later.
